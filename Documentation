Comprehensive Project Documentation: Interior Design Website
________________________________________
1. Executive Summary
Objective: Build a scalable, secure, and visually appealing website for an interior design company to showcase services, display portfolios, and allow customers to book consultations online.
________________________________________
2. Application Architecture
Overview:
•	Presentation Tier: User interface, accessible through a browser, built with Angular or React.
•	Business Logic Tier: Processes user requests, enforces business rules, and interacts with the database.
•	Data Tier: Stores all website-related data, including user details, bookings, portfolio items, etc.
Workflow Example:
1.	A customer visits the website and browses the portfolio.
2.	The frontend makes an API request to the backend.
3.	The backend retrieves portfolio data from the database and sends it back to the frontend.
4.	The frontend displays the data dynamically.
________________________________________
3. Requirements
Functional Requirements:
•	User registration and login with multi-factor authentication.
•	Display of design portfolios with filtering (e.g., by room type, style).
•	Booking form for scheduling consultations.
•	Dashboard for administrators to upload new projects, view bookings, and manage content.
Non-Functional Requirements:
•	Website uptime of 99.9% (high availability).
•	Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop users.
•	Support for up to 10,000 concurrent users.
•	Page load time under 2 seconds.

4. Technology Stack
Layer	Technology	Details
Frontend	Angular/React	SPA framework for dynamic interfaces.
	TypeScript, Bootstrap, Angular Material	For interactivity and design.
Backend	ASP.NET Core	RESTful APIs and business logic.
Database	AWS RDS (SQL Server)	Relational database for structured data.
Cloud Infrastructure	AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront, RDS, Route53)	Hosting, storage, and DNS services.
CI/CD	AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins	Automating builds and deployments.

5. Detailed Design
Frontend Design
•	Wireframes and Mockups: Create screens for homepage, portfolio, contact form, and admin dashboard.
•	Key Features:
o	Navigation bar with links to Home, Portfolio, About Us, and Contact.
o	Dynamic portfolio grid with filtering options.
o	User-friendly booking form with calendar integration.
•	Example API Interaction:
o	Fetching portfolio items:
fetch('/api/portfolio')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => displayPortfolio(data));
Backend Design
•	Layered Architecture:
o	Controllers: Handle API requests, e.g., GET /api/bookings.
o	Services: Process business logic.
o	Repositories: Handle database operations.
•	Example API Endpoint
[HttpGet]
[Route("api/portfolio")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetPortfolioItems() {
    var items = await _portfolioService.GetAllItems();
    return Ok(items);
}

6. AWS Cloud Setup
Compute:
•	Use EC2 instances to host the ASP.NET backend.
•	Configure Auto Scaling to handle traffic spikes.
Storage:
•	S3 buckets to store static files like images and CSS files.
•	CloudFront for fast content delivery.
Networking:
•	VPC with private and public subnets.
•	Route53 for DNS management.
Security:
•	IAM roles and policies for resource access.
•	Security groups for restricting inbound traffic.
Monitoring:
•	Use CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instances and RDS.
•	Set alarms for high CPU usage or memory leaks.

7. Development Plan
Sprint 1:
•	Setup AWS infrastructure and configure CI/CD.
•	Create frontend scaffolding (e.g., routing, basic components).
Sprint 2:
•	Develop user authentication (registration, login).
•	Implement backend APIs for portfolio management.
Sprint 3:
•	Create the portfolio display page.
•	Integrate APIs into frontend components.
Sprint 4:
•	Add booking functionality with calendar integration.
•	Deploy to staging environment for testing.

8. Security Measures
•	Authentication: Use OAuth2 or AWS Cognito for secure login.
•	Encryption: Enable HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates.
•	Data Security: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
•	API Security: Protect APIs using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
________________________________________
9. Deployment Strategy
1.	Environment Setup: Separate environments for development, staging, and production.
2.	CI/CD Pipeline:
o	Automate builds using Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline.
o	Deploy code changes with zero downtime.
________________________________________
10. Testing Plan
•	Unit Testing: Use xUnit for backend logic.
•	Integration Testing: Test APIs with Postman or Swagger.
•	Load Testing: Simulate heavy user traffic with JMeter.
•	UI Testing: Use Selenium to test frontend interactions.
________________________________________
11. Maintenance and Monitoring
•	Regular software updates and patches.
•	CloudWatch alerts for unexpected downtime.
•	Automated daily backups of RDS.
